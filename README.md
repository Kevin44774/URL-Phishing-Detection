# URL-Phishing-Detection
* Project presents a pioneering endeavour at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) to combat phishing attempts.
* Employing a multifaceted approach, this research work integrates XGBoost, LightGBM, Na√Øve Bayes and CatBoost algorithms, alongside a Graph Neural Network (GNN), to meticulously analyse URL structures, content patterns, and user behaviour.
* Features such as URL length, dots, slashes, numbers, and special characters are extracted for comprehensive model training.
* Real-time monitoring ensures the continual adaptation of the system to emerging phishing tactics, enhancing its efficacy in proactively safeguarding users and organizations from the dynamic and evolving realm of cyber threats.
* This Project encapsulates a comprehensive exploration of diverse machine learning methodologies to fortify online security against the pervasive threat of phishing.

## Tools
* Google Colab for training Models.

## Future Scope
* More models can be added.
* A website can be made for better user interaction.
